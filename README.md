# Detecting-Injection-using-RNNs

Application programming interfaces (APIs) are a vital part of every online business. APIs are responsible for transferring data across systems within a company or to the users through the web or mobile applications. Security is a concern for any public-facing application. The objective of this study is to analyze incoming requests to a target API and flag any malicious activity. This project proposes a solution using sequence models to identify whether or not an API request has SQL, XML, JSON, and other types of malicious injections. 

This project is an implementation of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376034">Evaluation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Detecting Injections in API Requests</a>
